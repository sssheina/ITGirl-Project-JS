## About The Project

A GTD planner that allows you to break down large projects into small steps and progress towards full implementation without procrastination. 

The app was created by a team of developers and designers from DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT CREATORS as part of a training project.
<br>
<br>
## Inspiration for the Project

After learning about the GTD (Getting Things Done)  planning system and trying to implement it into my daily routine, I was faced with the need to often rewrite unfinished tasks into new lists, which became a big obstacle for me. I tried for several years to find a suitable application for this system that covered my needs, but couldn't find one. So, having previously developed a project hierarchy and quick to-do system based on the GTD system, I offered to make this simple and effective application to the team.

## How we built it

We wanted to best model the work environment, so we started with an in-depth understanding of the problem with a proper focus group survey, which led to the creation of functions and prioritisation of those functions. After prioritising, we divided the workload into small parts.

First I built a hierarchy of task lists and made a prototype in Figma, based on which I implemented the layout design. 
We made array lists with pop-up modal windows, as our task was to practice JS and CSS skills.
<br>
<br>

## Challenges we ran into

We wanted to implement this project as best we could. There were so many things we wanted to add, and we needed to do so many things so that every feature was also very useful. Communication and clear results were key, especially with our big time difference.

But we were faced with the issue of storing personal data, which in this project is still stored in Local Storage.
<br>
<br>

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Exploring new areas of development and new languages and frameworks that we now feel we can confidently continue to build for our own projects. We have done so much during our time working on the project, and we are so proud of what we have created and how this application can help us and others improve the quality of life.
<br>
<br>

## What's next for GTD planner

We would like to keep working, create a useful application and collaborate with more community members to develop the backend part of the project. And do user authorisation for better usability.
